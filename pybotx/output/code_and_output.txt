Step 1: Plan & Approach
==========================

Problem Decomposition:

1. **Inputs:**
   - Target amount (future value, FV)
   - Accumulation duration in years (n)
   - Annual return rate (default: 12%)
   - All parameters can be input as lists for “what-if” analysis

2. **What to Compute for Each Combination:**
   - Required monthly SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)
   - Total invested (monthly SIP x total months)
   - Interest earned (future value minus total invested)

3. **Key Formulas Used:**
   - Monthly rate: `i = annual_return / 12 / 100`
   - Number of months: `N = years * 12`
   - **SIP formula inversion:**
     - FV = SIP * [(1 + i)^N - 1] / i  →  SIP = FV * i / [(1 + i)^N - 1]
   - Total invested: SIP * N
   - Interest earned: FV - (SIP * N)

4. **Robustness/Edge Cases:**
   - Handles zero/negative returns or durations
   - Results in 'infinity' SIP if accumulation not possible due to math/inputs
   - Easily adjustable for different targets, durations, and returns

5. **Improvements:**
   - Flexible for batch and custom analysis
   - Production setting would include input validation/error handling
   - Integrate with CSV/DataFrame output or input prompts for wider usability

Step 2: The Complete Python Code
==========================

```python
# Step 1: Plan the logic
'''
Problem Decomposition:
1. Inputs:
   - Target amount (future value, FV)
   - Years to accumulate (n)
   - Annual expected return (rate, r) -- default 12%
   - These may be provided as default sets or custom user input
2. Calculate required monthly SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)
3. Calculate total invested (monthly amount * months)
4. Calculate total interest earned (final corpus - total invested)

Finance principle applied:
(Future Value of a SIP) 
  FV = SIP * [(1 + i)^N - 1] / i
  where:
    SIP = monthly investment
    i = monthly interest rate (annual_rate/12)
    N = total months
Given the FV, we need to invert to solve for required SIP:
  SIP = FV * i / [(1 + i)^N - 1]

Algorithm Steps:
- For each target/duration/annual_return tuple,
  - Compute monthly rate (i), num of months (N)
  - Compute required SIP as above
  - Compute total investment (SIP * N)
  - Compute total interest (FV - total investment)
- Output nicely formatted table

Robustness/Edge Cases:
- Zero/negative inputs, large numbers
- Allow for user changes in goal, years, etc.
- Accuracy with float calculations

\nObservations:
- Longer the duration or higher the return, the lower the monthly SIP needed.
- SIP calculation robustly handles division by zero or negative durations (returns 'inf').

==========================
Step 4: Observations, Edge Cases, Suggestions
==========================

**Observations:**
- **Duration vs SIP:** The longer the accumulation period and/or the higher the assumed return, the less you need to save monthly.
- **Interest Dominates:** With longer duration (at high returns), interest earned vastly outweighs principal invested.
- **Robust Handling:** The system computes 'inf' for edge cases (like zero duration or negative rate), which is appropriate as those scenarios are not viable in real life. Full input validation is recommended for production.
- **Customization:** The code is structured for custom, batchable “what-if” analysis and easily extensible.

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Negative or zero years/returns (produces 'infinity' SIP) – flags impossibility
- Custom goals and durations supported
- Float precision ensured for financial calculations

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Accept interactive user input or configuration files
- Export as CSV or pandas DataFrame for deeper analysis or record keeping
- Add input validation for production use
- Consider advanced SIP schemes (step-up, irregular, etc.)
