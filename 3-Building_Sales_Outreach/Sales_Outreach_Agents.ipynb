    "\n",
    "1. **Check Your Spam Folder**\n",
    "   - Many students found their emails in **Spam** or **Promotions** folders.\n",
    "   - Mark the email as \"Not Spam\" to ensure future delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Print the Result Object**\n",
    "   - Run the following in your notebook:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     print(result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Look closely for any error messages, especially those related to **SSL** or **network issues**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If You See SSL Errors**\n",
    "   - You may need to adjust networking settings on your local machine.\n",

    "4. **Review Your OpenAI Trace**\n",
    "   - OpenAI‚Äôs dashboard provides trace logs ‚Äî use them to inspect tool calls and failures.\n",
    "   - Look for `\"tool_call\"` or `\"tool_result\"` in the timeline for clues.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check SendGrid Activity Logs**\n",
    "   - Visit [SendGrid Dashboard ‚Üí Email Activity](https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity)\n",
    "   - Look for bounce messages, failures, or blocks.\n",
    "   - Make sure your **sender email is verified**.\n",
